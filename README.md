# Health Care Prediction on Diabetic Patients - Case Study

## Context

This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its primary objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on specific diagnostic measurements. The dataset was carefully selected, focusing on female patients aged at least 21 years and of Pima Indian heritage.

## Problem Statement

Build a model with high accuracy to predict whether patients in the dataset have diabetes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various medical predictor variables and one target variable, "Outcome." The predictor variables encompass essential health metrics, such as the number of pregnancies, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold thickness, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age.

### Predictor Variables

1. **Pregnancies:**
   - Number of times pregnant

2. **Glucose:**
   - Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

3. **BloodPressure:**
   - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

4. **SkinThickness:**
   - Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

5. **Insulin:**
   - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

6. **BMI:**
   - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

7. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:**
   - Diabetes pedigree function : The Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) is a mathematical function used to assess the risk of diabetes in individuals based on their family history of the disease.

8. **Age:**
   - Age in years

### Target Variable

- **Outcome:**
   - Class variable (0 or 1)
   - 268 instances are labeled as 1 (indicating diabetes), while others are labeled as 0.

This dataset provides a valuable opportunity to develop a predictive model for diabetes based on demographic and health-related features.
